# TransHI
#### An Iterative Pipeline for Embedding Knowledge Graphs

This repository pertains to my thesis, the objective of which is to devise a new method for embedding knowledge graphs (KGs). The method conceived is termed "TransHI", which is an iterative pipeline that incorporates not only an innovative training algorithm but also a pre-processing phase and a mechanism to generate varied training data for use across multiple iterations of the pipeline.

The creation of TransHI, particularly its training algorithm, was inspired by the TransOWL algorithm (https://github.com/Keehl-Mihael/TransROWL-HRS). TransOWL is an embedding algorithm that leverages the ontology knowledge associated with KGs to generate negative triples. Recognizing areas for enhancement in TransOWL, a novel training algorithm was constructed.

The TransHI's pipeline is depicted:
